# freecodecamp_scientific_python
Tackling the projects assigned under the module "Scientific programming with python" in freecodecamp.

Each problem will have it's own folder along with the infomation given to solve the problem. My solution will also be included in the same folder. 

A personal learning log to document my progress at self-learning programming with a career in software development as the goal in mind.

Will be revisiting these these problems periodically to check if refactoring of code is possible based on any newly gained insight/knowledge.
